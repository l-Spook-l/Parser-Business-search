# Regional Enterprise Parser
This parser is designed to extract names and addresses of enterprises from the selected region's HTML markup and save the retrieved data to an Excel file.

## Project Description
The parser performs the following actions:

1. HTML Markup Parsing: Extracting enterprise information from an HTML page.
2. Data Extraction: Obtaining the name and address of each enterprise.
3. Data Saving: Storing the obtained enterprise names and addresses in an Excel file.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local computer:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/enterprise-parser.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```shell
    cd enterprise-parser
   
3. Install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:

### Note
Before running the parser, ensure that you have access to the HTML page containing the enterprises and that the HTML element selectors are correctly specified.
For using the parser in different regions or on different websites, you may need to adjust the parser's parameters according to the HTML markup of the specific data source.
